As name suggests Data Definition Language defines and manages the structures of database.
It doesn't manipulate data/records inside rows instead it modifies columns. 
You can vusialize it as a box rather than toys inside the box.


1. CREATE DATABSE company;
-  It is the first step, you must create a database first then add data.


2. CREATE TABLE employee (
   Id INT PRIMARY KEY, 
   Name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
   Address VARCHAR (50)
   Hired Date DATE,
   Salary NUMERIC (10,2)
);
-  It  creates a table named as Student, with columns ID, Name, Class, Address.


SELECT * FROM employee;
This shows whole table with the data but here i havent added any rows so it will only show columns.
